## 🤗 Dev Branches
Deploying to Dev Branches is a great way for us to get specific Komoco Staff to validate our work, early on in the development process. This is a great way to get feedback and make sure we are on the right track.

## 📝 Dev Branch Checklist
- [ ] Do you know who will need to be contacted to validate this work?
- [ ] Have you compiled a list of questions for the person validating this work?
- [ ] Does the Dev Db need to be wiped and re-imported?
- [ ] Checked if there are anu outstanding deployments currently deployed to Dev, which this would overwrite?
